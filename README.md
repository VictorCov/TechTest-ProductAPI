## GlobalMobilityApexTest

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, you need to set up the environment by running the `docker-compose.yml` file from the following repository:
[VictorCov/TechTest-JavaWorker](https://github.com/VictorCov/TechTest-JavaWorker).
This will initialize the database, Redis, and Kafka in Docker.

### Running the Application Locally
Once the environment is up, you can run the application locally. To check the exposed endpoints, use Swagger:
[http://localhost:8081/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8081/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html)
